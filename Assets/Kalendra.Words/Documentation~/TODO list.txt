[x] Use hashset where useful to infer invariants.
    [x] Example: instead of lists in Thesaurus words entries.
    [x] DISCARDED: HashSet in Abecedary (cause "index" is meaningless in a HashSet).
[x] Abecedary is not case sensitive.
[ ] UML invariants.
[ ] Study cases where non case-sensitive chars might be error-prone.

[ ] Polish API. Example: Thesaurus.HasWord is [Pure]

[-] GameLexicon, besides alphabet distribution, splits vowels and consonants distribution.
[ ] Alphabet knows what letters are vowels? Or it's implicit by aforesaid splitting?
    [ ] If GameLexicon somehow knows about vowels, distributions are internally made.
[ ] IsVowel() as an alternative extension method?

[x] DISCARDED: Thesaurus getting some random words from size?
[x] Thesaurus using uniform ToLower() or ToUpper() conversion as invariant when in/out words.
[x] DISCARDED: Thesaurus GetWordOfSize(int) when param overflows max size.
    *API returns null for any size not contained in Thesaurus.

[x] ValuedAlphabet GetRandomLetterByValue().
