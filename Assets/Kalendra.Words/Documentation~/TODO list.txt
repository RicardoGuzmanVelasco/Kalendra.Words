[ ] GameLexicon, besides alphabet distribution, splits vowels and consonants distribution.
[ ] Alphabet knows what letters are vowels? Or it's implicit by aforesaid splitting?
    [ ] If GameLexicon somehow knows about vowels, distributions are internally made.
[ ] IsVowel() as an alternative extension method?

[ ] Thesaurus getting some random words from size (not all in due to performance).
[ ] Thesaurus using uniform ToLower() or ToUpper() conversion as invariant when in/out words.
